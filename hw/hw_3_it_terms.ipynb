Most Unix users schedule cron jobs to carry out system maintenance tasks, like deleting log files and creating backups, but a user can schedule any command or script they find useful.\n",
      "Cursor A cursor is a movable icon on a computer screen that indicates where user input will take place. The two most common cursor types are the mouse cursor (which selects objects and clicks buttons) and the text cursor (which shows where the next typed character appears). Both cursors are controlled by the computer's mouse or trackpad, and the text cursor may also be controlled by the keyboard.\n",
      "Cut Cut is a command that allows you to \"cut out\" a selection of text or other data and save it to the clipboard.  It is similar to the Copy command, but instead of just copying the data to the clipboard, it removes the selected data at the same time.  For example, if you highlight a sentence in a word processing program and select \"Cut,\" the sentence is removed from the document and is added to the clipboard.  Therefore, selecting \"Cut\" is an simple way to both copy and delete a selection in a single step.\n",
      "Daemon A daemon (also known as a \"background process\") is a program that runs in the background and performs tasks without any input from the computer's user. Instead, they wait for specific triggering events or conditions before performing their functions.

However, even if a photo is printed with a high DPI, the detail represented in the photo can only be as high as the PPI.\n",
      "PPM Stands for \"Pages Per Minute.\"  PPM is used to measure the printing speed of both inkjet and laser printers.  Most printers include a PPM rating for both black and color documents.  These speed measurements are typically listed in the printer's technical specifications.\n",
      "Prefetch Prefetching is an optimization technique that fetches data and loads it into memory before that data is actually requested. When successful, prefetching improves performance and reduces latency because an application does not need to read data from a slower storage disk but can instead access it from a faster memory cache. However, it requires that the system accurately predicts what data an application or process needs in advance. Prefetching can lead to wasted resources if the system makes incorrect predictions.\n",
      "Pretest Before releasing products for sale, companies often pretest their products for safety and reliability.  This process typically involves detecting and fixing errors and making improvements if necessary.  In the computer industry, pretesting can be performed on both hardware and software.\n",
      "Primary Key A primary key is a unique identifier value for a database record in a table.

Rational numbers may be expressed as a fraction (such as 7/8) and irrational numbers may be expressed by an infinite decimal representation (3.1415926535...).  Real numbers that include decimal points are also called floating point numbers, since the decimal \"floats\" between the digits.\n",
      "Real-Time When an event or function is processed instantaneously, it is said to occur in real-time.  To say something takes place in real-time is the same as saying it is happening \"live\" or \"on-the-fly.\"  For example, the graphics in a 3D action game are rendered in real-time by the computer's video card.  This means the graphics are updated so quickly, there is no noticeable delay experienced by the user.  While some computer systems may be capable of rendering more frames per second than other systems, the graphics are still being processed in real-time.\n",
      "Recursion Recursion is a process in computer programming in which a function calls on itself as a subroutine. The concept is helpful when addressing a problem that can be solved by breaking it up into smaller copies of the same problem. Every time a recursive function runs, it tells itself to run again, not stopping until it meets a specified condition. Functions that incorporate recursion are called recursive functions.\n",
      "Recursive Function A recursive function is a function that calls itself during its execution.  The process may repeat several times, outputting the result and the end of each iteration.\n",
      "Redundancy The general definition of redundancy is exceeding what is normal.  However, in computing, the term is used more specifically and refers to duplicate devices that are used for backup purposes.  The goal of redundancy is to prevent or recover from the failure of a specific component or system.\n",
      "Refresh Refresh is a command that reloads the contents of a window or Web page with the most current data.  For example, a window may list files stored within a folder, but may not track their location in real-time.  If the files have been moved or deleted since the window was first opened, the folder contents displayed will be inaccurate.  By refreshing the window, a current list of files is displayed.\n",
      "Refresh Rate Computer monitors often have a \"maximum refresh rate\" listed in their technical specifications.  This number, measured in hertz (Hz), determines how many times the screen is redrawn each second.  Typical refresh rates for CRT monitors include 60, 75, and 85 Hz.  Some monitors support refresh rates of over 100 Hz.\n",
      "ReFS Stands for \"Resilient File System.\"\n",
      "Regular Expression A regular expression (or \"regex\") is a search pattern used for matching one or more characters within a string.  It can match specific characters, wildcards, and ranges of characters.  Regular expressions were originally used by Unix utilities, such as vi and grep.  However, they are now supported by many code editing applications and word processors on multiple platforms.  Regular expressions can also be used in most major programming languages.\n",
