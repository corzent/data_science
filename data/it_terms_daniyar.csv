Term,Definition
3G,"3G is a collection of third generation cellular data technologies.  The first generation (1G) was introduced in 1982, while the second generation of cellular data technologies (2G) became standardized in the early 1990s.  3G technologies were introduced as early as 2001, but did not gain widespread use until 2007."
403 Error,"A 403 error is an HTTP error code that indicates access to a specific URL is forbidden.  Websites often display 403 errors with a generic message such as, ""You don't have permission to access this resource."""
404 Error,"A 404 error is a common website error message that indicates a webpage cannot be found.  It may be produced when a user clicks an outdated (or ""broken"") link or when a URL is typed incorrectly in a Web browser's address field.  Some websites display custom 404 error pages, which may look similar to other pages on the site.  Other websites simply display the Web server's default error message text, which typically begins with ""Not Found.""  Regardless of the appearance, a 404 error means the server is up and running, but the webpage or path to the webpage is not valid."
4G,"4G is a collection of fourth generation cellular data technologies.  It succeeds 3G and is also called ""IMT-Advanced,"" or ""International Mobile Telecommunications Advanced.""  4G was made available as early as 2005 in South Korea under the name WiMAX and was rolled out in several European countries over the next few years.  It became available in the United States in 2009, with Sprint being the first carrier to offer a 4G cellular network."
5G,"5G is the fifth generation of cellular data technology.  It succeeds 4G and related technologies, including LTE.  The first 5G cellular networks were constructed in 2018, while 5G devices became widespread in 2019 and 2020."
ActiveX,ActiveX is a technology introduced by Microsoft in 1996 as part of the OLE framework.  It includes a collection of prewritten software components that developers can implement within an application or webpage.  This provides a simple way for programmers to add extra functionality to their software or website without needing to write code from scratch.
Address Bar,"An address bar is a text field near the top of a Web browser window that displays the URL of the current webpage.  The URL, or web address, reflects the address of the current page and automatically changes whenever you visit a new webpage.  Therefore, you can always check the location of the webpage you are currently viewing with the browser's address bar."
Adware,"Adware is free software that is supported by advertisements. Instead of generating revenue through sales, an adware developer sells online ads that appear while the app runs. The developer may also sell an upgraded ad-free version of their software to users who want to use the app without ads."
Affiliate,"An Internet affiliate is a company, organization, or individual that markets another company's products through their website.  In exchange for marketing their products, companies pay affiliates a commission for each sale they generate."
Ajax,"Ajax is a combination of Web development technologies used for creating dynamic websites.  While the term ""Ajax"" is not written in all caps like most tech acronyms, the letters stand for ""Asynchronous JavaScript And XML.""  Therefore, websites that use Ajax combine JavaScript and XML to display dynamic content."
Apache,"Apache is the most popular Web server software.  It enables a computer to host one or more websites that can be accessed over the Internet using a Web browser.  The first version of Apache was released in 1995 by the Apache Group.  In 1999, the Apache Group became the Apache Software Foundation, a non-profit organization that currently maintains the development of the Apache Web server software."

Similar to how a person's backbone carries signals to and from smaller groups of nerves in their nervous system, a backbone network forms the central communications infrastructure that transmits data between networks. The largest backbone network connects ISPs around the world to create the Internet."
Backlink,"A backlink is an incoming link from an external website to specific webpage.  For example, if you publish a webpage and 20 other websites link to it, your webpage has 20 backlinks.  Links to the page from within your own website are not included in the backlink total."
Banner Ad,"Whether you like it or not, much of the Web is run by advertising.  Just like television or radio, websites can offer free content by generating revenue from advertising.  While you may get tired of Web ads from time to time, most people would agree that seeing a few advertisements here and there is better than paying a usage fee for each website."
Bcc,"Stands for ""Blind Carbon Copy.""  Bcc is an email field that allows you to ""blind"" copy one or more recipients.  It is similar to the Cc field, but email addresses listed in the Bcc field are hidden from all recipients."
BGP,"Stands for ""Border Gateway Protocol.""  BGP is a protocol used for routing data transmissions over the Internet.  It helps determine the most efficient path, whether sending data down the street or across the globe."

BitTorrent,BitTorrent is an open-source peer-to-peer (P2P) file-sharing protocol. It decentralizes the distribution of files by making each client that downloads a file also act as a server other clients can download from. It even allows the original file host to drop offline without affecting the availability of that file as long as at least one other computer has a full copy of it.
Blog,"A blog (short for ""web log"") is a type of website that consists of regularly-published posts â€” articles, journal entries, links to websites and articles, and other types of text-based content. A blog is typically maintained by a single person or a small group of contributors; it may focus on a single subject or cover a wide variety of topics based on the author's experiences, opinions, and expertise. The word ""blog"" may also be used as a verb to mean the act of writing and posting content to a blog, and people who write blogs are known as bloggers."

In either case, a brute force attack tries different username and password combinations with the hope of discovering a valid login."
Captcha,"A captcha is program used to verify that a human, rather than a computer, is entering data.  Captchas are commonly seen at the end of online forms and ask the user to enter text from a distorted image.  The text in the image may be wavy, have lines through it, or may be highly irregular, making it nearly impossible for an automated program to recognize it.  (Of course, some captchas are so distorted that they can be difficult for humans to recognize as well.)  Fortunately, most captchas allow the user to regenerate the image if the text is too difficult to read.  Some even include an auditory pronunciation feature."

Cloud,"The term ""cloud"" comes from early network diagrams, in which the image of a cloud was used to indicate a large network, such as a WAN.  The cloud eventually became associated with the entire Internet, and the two terms are now used synonymously.  The cloud may also be used to describe specific online services, which are collectively labeled ""cloud computing."""
Cloud Computing,"Cloud computing refers to applications and services offered over the Internet.  These services are offered from data centers all over the world, which collectively are referred to as the ""cloud.""  This metaphor represents the intangible, yet universal nature of the Internet."

Cybersquatter,"In the early days of the United States, pioneers traveled west and claimed federal land as their own.  These people were called ""squatters,"" since they claimed rights to the land simply by occupying it.  In the mid-1800s, during the California gold rush, squatters became especially prominent and settled land throughout the west coast."
Datagram,"Datagram is a combination of the words data and telegram.  Therefore, it is a message containing data that is sent from location to another.  A datagram is similar to a packet, but does not require confirmation that it has been received.  This makes datagrams ideal for streaming services, where the constant flow of data is more important than 100% accuracy."
Denial of Service,"A denial of service attack is an effort to make one or more computer systems unavailable.  It is typically targeted at web servers, but it can also be used on mail servers, name servers, and any other type of computer system."
DHCP,"Stands for ""Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol.""  DHCP is a protocol that automatically assigns a unique IP address to each device that connects to a network.  With DHCP, there is no need to manually assign IP addresses to new devices.  Therefore, no user configuration is necessary to connect to a DHCP-based network.  Because of its ease of use and widespread support, DHCP is the default protocol used by most routers and networking equipment."
Dial-up,"Dial-up refers to an Internet connection that is established using a modem.  The modem connects the computer to standard phone lines, which serve as the data transfer medium.  When a user initiates a dial-up connection, the modem dials a phone number of an Internet Service Provider (ISP) that is designated to receive dial-up calls.  The ISP then establishes the connection, which usually takes about ten seconds and is accompanied by several beeping an buzzing sounds."

An e-commerce transaction occurs whenever someone buys goods or services from a business' website. An e-commerce transaction can take lots of forms, such as a person buying a piece of software that they can download, ordering a pair of shoes to be delivered, or hiring an artist to draw a picture."
E-mail Bankruptcy,"In this day and age, most of us receive several e-mails a day.  Depending on your job, you may even receive dozens of daily messages that are not spam.  While it is hard enough to keep up with this plethora of e-mails received in a single day, if you fall behind a few days, it can be nearly impossible to catch up.  After awhile, you may end up with hundreds of messages in your inbox that have not been replied to."
Edge Caching,"Edge caching is a mechanism content delivery networks (CDNs) use to cache Internet content in different locations around the world.  Examples include website data, cloud storage, and streaming media.  By storing copies of files in multiple ""edge"" locations, a CDN can deliver content to users more quickly than a single server can."

Firewall,"A physical firewall is a wall made of brick, steel, or other inflammable material that prevents the spread of a fire in a building.  In computing, a firewall serves a similar purpose.  It acts as a barrier between a trusted system or network and outside connections, such as the Internet.  However, a computer firewall is more of a filter than a wall, allowing trusted data to flow through it."
Flaming,"Flaming is the act of posting or sending offensive messages over the Internet.  These messages, called ""flames,"" may be posted within online discussion forums or newsgroups, or sent via e-mail or instant messaging programs.  The most common area where flaming takes place is online discussion forums, which are also called bulletin boards."
Flash,"Macromedia Flash (later Adobe Flash) was a multimedia web browser plug-in that enabled animations, video, and interactive content on websites. Flash was an extremely popular plug-in for more than a decade, but it eventually fell out of favor due to a combination of performance and security problems and the introduction of HTML5 and its multimedia features."
Fluid Layout,A fluid layout is a type of webpage design in which layout of the page resizes as the window size is changed.  This is accomplished by defining areas of the page using percentages instead of fixed pixel widths.
Friend,"A friend, in the traditional sense of the word, is a close acquaintance.  An online friend, however, is simply a person added to your list of friends on a social networking website."
Friendly URL,"A friendly URL is a Web address that is easy to read and includes words that describe the content of the webpage.  This type of URL can be ""friendly"" in two ways.  1) It can help visitors remember the Web address, and 2) it can help describe the page to search engines."

The gopher system allows people to search for and retrieve information using a text interface.  The technology is based on a client-server structure, where a gopher client program is used to search gopher servers.  These servers can store documents, articles, programs, and other information.  Instead of hyperlinks, the gopher interface uses menus of links to other documents and programs."
Graymail,"Graymail describes email messages that are generally unwanted, but do not fit the definition of spam.  Unlike spam, graymail includes messages from mailing lists and newsletters that you have legitimately signed up to receive.  Over time, these messages can begin to clutter your inbox and can easily be mistaken for spam."

In order to tag a keyword in a Twitter post, simply type a number symbol (Shift+3) immediately before the word.  For example, you can tag the word ""tech"" in a tweet by typing ""#tech."""
Heartbleed,"Heartbleed is a security hole in OpenSSL that was discovered by the Finnish security firm Codenomicon and publicized on April 7, 2014.  OpenSSL is the encryption technology used to create secure website connections over HTTPS, establish VPNs, and encrypt several other protocols.  Since OpenSSL is used by roughly two-thirds of web servers, the vulnerability is considered one of the most significant security holes discovered since the beginning of the web."
Hit,"A hit is a metric used in website analytics.  While ""hits"" and ""visits"" are sometimes used interchangeably, they are two different things.  A visit is recorded when a user visits a webpage.  A hit is recorded for each resource that is downloaded from a web server.  Therefore, it is common for hits to outnumber visits, often by a ratio of more than 10 to 1."
Home Page,"A home page is a webpage that serves as the starting point of website.  It is the default webpage that loads when you visit a web address that only contains a domain name.  For example, visiting https://techterms.com will display the Tech Terms home page."
Honeypot,"A honeypot is a security system designed to detect and counteract unauthorized access or use of a computer system.
